## How to use
 
Video control bar created from scratch.
in addition to pausing and playing, an input range was used to visually follow the video's progress and at the same time allow the video to advance and rewind just by dragging the bar cursor.<br>

The same button is used to pause and play the video, changing, in addition to its functionality, the icon and verifying that autoplay is activated to suit it.<br>

The bar is hidden, being visible when the mouse cursor is over it and, after a few seconds, it starts to disappear with a transition effect.<br>
